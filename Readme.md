# Beyond Voice Commands: A Comprehensive Visual-Audio Model for Mobile Device Operation

## Abstract
With the era of large language models (LLMs) on the horizon and the possibilities that come with it, this research explores the future integration of voice assistants with LLMs. Our approach leverages voice-to-text APIs, LLM inference capabilities, and single-shot detection models to execute voice commands autonomously, eliminating the need for system-specific customizations. We present a robust visual-audio model that enhances task completion accuracy and efficiency.

## Introduction
Existing voice assistants rely on internal APIs or mobile metadata to perform tasks, but our approach integrates LLMs with voice commands. Using state-of-the-art models like Grounding DINO and CLIP, we generalize a wider range of instructions and execute them using a crafted execution engine. This method requires minimal system-specific customization and demonstrates the potential for smaller, more efficient models like Phi 1.5 to run on mobile devices   .

## Methodology
1. *Zero-Shot Object Detection*: Utilizing Grounding DINO and CLIP for robust visual-text interactions.
2. *Speech to Text Conversion*: Employing the OpenAI Whisper model to convert speech to text.
3. *Dynamic Visual Perception*: Using OpenCV for real-time visual processing.
4. *Command Execution*: Using ADB for executing commands via coordinate clicks.

## Results
### Performance Metrics
- *Success (S)*: If the visual-audio model successfully executes an instruction.
- *Accuracy Score (AS)*: The correctness of the model's execution, calculated as the number of correct steps divided by the total steps attempted.
- *Consistency (CO)*: The model's efficiency in using the mobile device, measured across 10 iterations with different starting points.
- *Completion Rate (CR)*: The percentage of successful iterations out of total iterations.

### Quantitative Results
- *Completion Rates*: Achieved 60%, 70%, and 70% for three sets of instructions, respectively.
- *Average Success Rate*: Approximately 80% across all operations.
- *Consistency Level*: Achieved 0.7 over multiple distinct iterations   .

### Improvement
- Achieved a 30% increase in task completion accuracy compared to existing voice assistants.

### Task Examples
1. *Open Instagram, Like and Comment*: The model searches for Instagram using OCR and icon detection, opens the app, likes the first picture, and comments "Good" on it .
